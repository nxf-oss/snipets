## **3. Principles of Responsible AI**

We commit to the following principles:

### **3.1 Transparency**

* Clearly disclose when AI is being used
* Provide explanations or documentation where possible
* Avoid “black box” implementations without justification

### **3.2 Fairness & Bias Mitigation**

* Regularly test AI components for potential bias
* Avoid datasets known to introduce discriminatory outcomes
* Allow users to report biased or harmful behavior

### **3.3 Privacy & Data Protection**

* Do not store or process personal data without explicit consent
* Follow applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
* Minimize data collection and anonymize data when possible

### **3.4 Safety & Security**

* Ensure AI outputs do not promote harm, misinformation, or illegal activity
* Validate AI decisions in sensitive or high-risk contexts
* Monitor for adversarial attacks or model misuse

### **3.5 Accountability**

* Human oversight is required for critical decisions
* Contributors are responsible for documenting model behavior
* Users can contact maintainers regarding AI-related concerns

---

## **4. Allowed and Prohibited Uses**

### **4.1 Allowed Uses**

AI within this project **may be used** for:

* Automation, optimization, or assistance features
* Enhancing usability or user experience
* Data analysis that respects privacy standards
* Non-harmful content generation

### **4.2 Prohibited Uses**

AI within this project **must NOT be used** for:

* Surveillance or tracking without explicit permission
* Discriminatory or harmful outcomes
* Generating misinformation or deceptive content
* Collecting or processing sensitive personal data
* Any use violating applicable laws or regulations

---

## **5. Data Handling & Model Training**

If datasets or models are used:

* Sources must be documented and legally obtained
* Training data must avoid copyrighted or proprietary material unless allowed
* Datasets containing personal information must be anonymized
* Model performance should be regularly evaluated and documented

---

## **6. Third-Party AI Services**

If the project integrates external AI APIs or services:

* Their terms of use must be reviewed and complied with
* Users should be informed of data sent to third-party providers
* Only reputable and secure providers may be used
* API keys and credentials must not be stored in the repository

---

## **7. User Disclosures**

AI-powered features must clearly inform users when:

* AI is generating content
* AI is making recommendations
* AI is processing user input

Where applicable, disclaimers should state:

> “This feature uses AI to assist or generate results. Outputs may not always be accurate.”

---

## **8. Reporting AI Issues**

Users and contributors may report:

* Harmful outputs
* Biased behavior
* Security vulnerabilities
* Ethical concerns

Reports can be submitted via:

* GitHub Issues
* Email: *[[your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com)]*

All reports will be reviewed promptly and addressed accordingly.

---

## **9. Contributor Requirements**

Contributors working with AI features must:

* Follow this policy and relevant laws
* Document model changes or updates
* Provide test cases for AI-powered functions
* Explain limitations or risks in pull requests

---

## **10. Policy Updates**

This policy may be updated to reflect:

* New regulations
* Improvements in ethical AI standards
* New features added to the project
